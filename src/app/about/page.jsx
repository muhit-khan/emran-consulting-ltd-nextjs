        <p>
          We believe that our strength lies in our collaborative approach, which
          puts our clients at the center of everything we do.

            Emran Consulting was founded by Shawn Shariar Emran, who realized that
            consulting firms were overcharging clients without providing quality services. From day one, we&apos;ve
            committed to pushing boundaries by charging our clients even more.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Emran Consulting, we&apos;re more than just colleagues â€” we&apos;re a
            family. We are dedicated to delivering high-quality service and
            expect our team to go above and beyond, including working late hours.
            We believe in work-life balance, ensuring our employees bring
            their full selves to work and maintain a healthy integration of work
            and personal life, albeit with a bit of extra time at the office.
